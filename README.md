# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple console implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe using [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm.

**Extra changed were applied:**
- The player can adjust size of game board at the beginning of the game (starting from 3x3)
- Win conditions:
  - 3x3: *three* in a row, column, or diagonal
  - 4x4: *four* in a row, column, or diagonal
  - 5x5 and more: *five* in a row, column, or diagonal



Algorithm and idea were taken from https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax
